# Neuromind

Neuromind is an ambitious project aimed at creating a mesh of neural networks with distinct conscious and unconscious components. The project is inspired by the structure and function of the human mind, with the goal of exploring advanced AI capabilities in decision-making, pattern recognition, and adaptive learning.

## Project Overview

Neuromind is designed to simulate the conscious and unconscious processes of the human brain through a network of interconnected neural models. The conscious part focuses on active decision-making and problem-solving, while the unconscious part handles background processes and pattern recognition.

### Key Features:
- **Conscious Part:** Handles real-time decision-making, context awareness, and reasoning.
- **Unconscious Part:** Manages background processing, automatic responses, and pattern recognition.
- **Interaction Layer:** Facilitates communication between conscious and unconscious parts.
- **Scalability:** Designed to scale from small experiments to large, real-world applications.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key directories:

- `data/`: Stores datasets and preprocessed data.
- `models/`: Contains saved models for both conscious and unconscious components.
- `src/`: The main source code directory, including data loaders, model implementations, and training scripts.
- `experiments/`: Logs, notebooks, and other experiment-related files.
- `config/`: Configuration files for the project.
- `utils/`: Utility scripts for metrics, visualization, and other helper functions.
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests to ensure code quality.

## Installation

To get started with Neuromind, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/neuromind.git
